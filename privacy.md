# Privacy Policy

## What do we collect
We take your privacy very seriously. When using the TweetInCord bot, we collect only the basic minimal data required for TweetInCord to function. This includes the people who you DM through the bot (this is just so the bot knows which Discord Channel a users DMs should be forwarded to), certain guild related prefrences such as what the bot prefix or feeds channel is for a server, as well as credentials for connecting to your Twitter Account.

## How do we use it
We use your data only to provide services with our bot. It is **never** shared or sold to third parties (with the exception of Discord and Twitter themselves, obviously).

## How do I delete my data
Currently there is no way to delete your data on demand, but we're looking into adding a `;deletealldata` command to the bot which causes the bot to leave the server and delete all data from our database. Additionally, all user data is deleted after two weeks after the bot leaves a server. Two weeks was chosen as a grace period so users will not have to reauthenticate and set the bot up again if the bot leaves the server.
